# AES-RAG

Official implementation of AES (Attention Escape Score) and PER (Pruning Escape Routes) for training-free RAG hallucination detection and mitigation via attention routing analysis.

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can still suffer from hallucinations even when relevant evidence is retrieved. We study this problem from the perspective of attention routing and propose **Attention Escape Score (AES)**, a training-free framework for diagnosing hallucination-prone generation.

AES characterizes attention escape through three complementary dimensions:

- **Semantic Anchoring**
- **Contextual Distraction**
- **Generation Inertia**

We further introduce **Pruning Escape Routes (PER)**, a lightweight inference-time intervention that attenuates attention heads associated with systematic escape routes.

## Features

- Training-free hallucination detection
- White-box attention-based analysis
- Interpretable attention routing signals
- Inference-time hallucination mitigation
- Support for multiple LLM families and RAG benchmarks
